<h1>Super energy boosting smoothies are a way to feel energized for the whole day.</h1>
<p>Eating healthy diet packed with vitamins and minerals is good way how to feel energized
  for the whole day and have the necessary energy to complete daily tasks, be succesful at work
  or at school. Some activities are draining, especilly when we are under huge stress or
  when some tasks are too demanding to complete, we need that boost. But where to get it?
  Our bodies need some fuel from the outside world, they are not able to create energy from nothing
  or even worse - from fast food or processed food. Think of it as when you have a plant or a car..
  When you take care of it patiently and you give it, what it needs, it will give you something back,
  some reward.</p>

<h2>Fruit and vegetables full of vitamins.</h2>
<p>We're not talking here about protein and healthy fats from meat and fish or even from eggs.
  For the refreshing smoothies are not suitable. Also lots of people have in mind, the more sweet
    the food is, the more energy they will get, right? It is not always true.</p>
<p>Sugary drinks, candy, and pastries put too much fuel (sugar) into our blood too quickly.
  The ensuing crash leaves us tired and hungry again after short amount of time.
  But with the healthy fats, complex carbohydrates and protein, body takes longer to digest.
  So it will satisfy your hunger, and provide a slow, steady stream of energy, which is exactly what we
  are looking for.</p>
  <p>Few examples of good, energizing fruit and veggies are:</p>
