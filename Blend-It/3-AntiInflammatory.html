<h1>Anti-inflammatory smoothies are vital part of an anti-inflammatory diet.</h1>
  <p>Inflammation occurs naturally as part of the bodyâ€™s immune response. Whenever you are
    fighting any nasty infection, illness or disease, your body is taking the energy
    to beat it. It is not only draining, but also in this stage it is more than neccesary
    to support your immune system and not to add the fuel to already burning fire.
    The inflamation levels stored in the body are well kept under control, but some factors
    can trigger these levels to go up and cause the illness or the infection to appear.

  <div class="list">
    <ol>
    <li>Smoking.</li>
    <li>Drinking.</li>
    <li>Bad diet, being obese or overweight.</li>
    <li>Autoimmune disorders.</li>
    <li>Long-term exposure to chemicals and irritants.</li>
    <li>Stress.</li>
  </ol>
  </div>
  <!--This content is seperated by div class "list", which is then styled in css. It contains <ol> tags, which

<p>There is of course many more, as it always depends on individual. But no matter the cause,
  prevention and treatment is the most important step.</p>
<h2>Reccomended fruit and veggies.</h2>
<p>The anti-inflammatory diet is mostly consisted of vegetables, fruit and omega-3
  fatty acids. That's why smoothies are perfect food/healthy drink on this diet, as it helps
  to have as many neccesary and reccomended nutritions as possible. Smoothies can not only be
  prepared as a healthy light drink, but also as a meal replacemnt to fill the stomach.</p>

<p>Let's listen to Lisa Bryan, food-lover, influencer and Youtuber, what anti-Inflammatory
  food is recommended for this diet, that can also be used to make delicious smoothie.</p>
